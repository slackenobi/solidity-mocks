# Auth-Ownership/OZ-3_0

* **Note: OpenZeppelin version 3.0 is currently in release candidate stage**

Patterns for authorization roles and ownership of solidity contracts based on OpenZeppelin Release Candidate ```@3.0rc1```. Individual library files located in ```./openzeppelin-3.0rc1```. To use library in a development|production project, install using NPM:

```sh
user@system:~$ npm i @openzeppelin/contracts@3.0rc1
```

No examples at present - only OZ contracts. Will update in future commit.
